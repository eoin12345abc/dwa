<title> project 3 </title>

<body>
My idea is to create a javascript app that will let the user create their own cellular automata.  <br>
<a href = "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_automaton" > <br>
The cellular automata will exist on a (possibly size-cusomizable) grid. <br
>Each grid box represents a cell that will live or die based on the existence of other living cells around it.<br>
They will be able to customize the live or die rules for the automata, as well as set the initial conditions for the cells. <br>
For example, say if neighboring live cells ==3, live, else die.  <br>
Life/Death are discreet processes that take are refreshed each "generation" or iteration. <br>
There will be some "animation" functionality showing the evolution of the cells as the generations proceed.<br>
